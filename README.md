# rp_tracker
RP_tracker is an api that makes the managing of roleplays easier.
This is done by easily creating,storing and manipulating character data and allowing to easily script dice rolls that can both tell the GM their outcome and even manipluate data on their own.

It is also usefull for normal players, as rp_tracker contains a list of roleplays that is easily searchable so they can find an online roleplay that they like and join, make a character and easily play with the dice themselves to get a feeling of how character stats effect the outcome if the roleplay is using a custom set of dice rules or if they are new to the specifc system that is in use.

This git repository only holds the API of the server and because of it isn't of much use for a user. A client for this API can be found at https://github.com/lenscas/rp_tracker_client

At this point though, rp_tracker (and the client) are far from finished, and as such isn't actually hosted. If you want to play around with it you will need apache\*, mysql and php7.

\*nginx and other servers that can run php scripts may also work but are at this point untested.
